## 📌 Project Description

This project is inspired by the idea that people with ADHD often struggle not with motivation, but with **starting tasks and staying engaged**.

Video games solve this using fast feedback loops:  
you act → you get instant feedback → your brain stays engaged.

This project applies the same idea to real life.

Instead of keeping tasks only on a screen, this tool prints your **daily schedule and tasks** on a **thermal receipt printer**, making them:
- physical and visible
- easy to start
- satisfying to complete

By combining:
- small task breakdowns
- instant printed feedback
- low effort task generation

the system reduces procrastination and cognitive overload, especially for ADHD brains.
